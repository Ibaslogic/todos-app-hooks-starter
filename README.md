### HTTP Request and lifecycle methods.

> check here for the **React Hooks version of the todos app**:

## Clone this project

You can download or clone this project by running this command from your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/Ibaslogic/http-request-lifecycle-methods
```

This will create a directory in the name of the project folder. In this case, `http-request-lifecycle-methods`.

Once you have the project files and folders bootstrapped, open it with your text editor. Here, I will be using VsCode.

Next, switch inside the directory (`cd http-request-lifecycle-methods`) and run:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies in the local `node_modules` folder.

Finally, start your development server by running:

```
npm start
```

You should see this app in your browser address bar at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
